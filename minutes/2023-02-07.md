## Agenda Items for Feb 7, 2023

### Revisit [RFC 75](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/75) - async_promise_test

Recap: Last [meeting](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt-notes/blob/master/minutes/2022-12-06.md), we discussed that we should revisit this again.

Action items:
- If not merged by next meeting, will merge. jgraham to review in between.

### Revisit [RFC 110] (https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/110) - support virtual test suites in wptrunner
Prototype implementation: https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/37912

Background:
- We currently have virutal tests in chromium.

Proposed changes:
Will need to make change to the CLI to understand the virutal config.

jgraham - wptrunner is currently not setup to support this new way of config. The PR is helpful to understand but would also like someone else like Sam to review this.
weizhong - should we make more vendors use the wptrunner. If we want to support virtual test, we will need to support test ID
jgraham - having multiple configs running is okay. But the problem is that the test id now  identifies the test and some subset of configuration
sam - I delegate to jgraham usually for virutal tests. What was the reason not to add virtual tests suite as run info and then outputing. Would align with more with the current design of wptrunner
weizhong - jgraham has put his ideas in the RFC.
Panos - Trying to move the test infrastructure from chromium to wptrunner. It would be great to move that over to prevent duplication of similar work
jgraham - will take another view of the PR. Agree that there should be some solution to this.
sam - any link to an actual test config file.

Action Items:
- jgraham and sam to take a look at the PR.
- weizhong will paste a link to a test config file in the chromium code. Put it in the PR.

### Test Investigation of Interop 2023

 - https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop-2023-mobile-testing
 - https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop/issues/201
 - https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/issues/126


Sam - Saw in some RFC for status quo if iOS from Memory. RFC 126. At the very starting point right now.
jgraham - Who should be in that meeting? Weizhong's team has the most context for mobile. Panos. And Philip

Action items:
- jgraham to copy this into the investigation repo.  And send out invite 

### RFC 131

- https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/131

Sam - I need to speak to others. Webkit and bug watchers
jgraham - Don't want to set an example where we did this for chrome and now we should do this for firefox
Panos - we don't provide an upstream way for engineers to deal with flakiness. Trying to reduce the pain of affected engineers
jgraham - If there's any way to improve the stability instead of blocking checks, might be worth the eng time.
Panos - would like to have a team staffed to port the flakiness support from chromium to wpt
james - an easier thing would be to document the system so that we can get more resources on it. But without knowing how the system looks like, it would be hard to start
panos - weizhong, do you have any links?
weizhong - currently the stability check is blocking the PR from landing. We should note but allow the PR to land.
panos - provided this as an option. will sync with weizhong offline.
jgraham - we don't have a generic way of sharing info to developers.
weizhong - in chromium CI, it will paste a comment to the CL of tha failure.
jgraham - it is possible to have a failed check not block.

Action items:
 - weizhong and panos to sync offline and add to the RFC around current chromium CI implementation
