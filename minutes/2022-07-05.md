## Minutes

* James: Let's use [this](https://pad.0b101010.services/wpt-infra-meeting?both) and then move to a new repository, with a single markdown file per meeting.

### RFC 113: Remove Origin Policy infrastructure

https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/113

3 approvals, some doubts from @gsnedders, but let's merge. Merging now. Filed https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/34707.

### RFC 114: Change results aggregation on wpt.fyi and visualization on Interop-20** views

https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/114

Approved by James yesterday, Philip fixed final comment. Will wait for Sam until end of week or so.

### RFC 115: Add a new test method that returns AbortSignal

https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/115

Per https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener#browser_compatibility the `signal` parameter for `addEventListener` is supported in recent Chrome, Firefox and Safari. We've sometimes had "supported for 2 years" as a condition, but for hard dependencies of testharness.js.

Could feature-detect the addEventListener signal parameter, but it could be used for new things.

What's the issue if we just allow it once it's in stable?

Mainly about testing old/unusual browsers e.g. Servo, Flow.

Maybe this won't be used too much at first, and even if it was used a it it probably won't be hard to switch back if there's a bigger problem.

We shouldn't approve large PRs to rewrite existing tests to the new mechanism.

(examine implementation PR)

foolip: I'm inclined to approve this. It seems like a usability win. Will using this result in a test error or a harness error? Depends on how you call it.

Should request JSDoc is updated to make clear that it's not OK to do async cleanup in event handler.

### RFC 108: Add testdriver.js support for WebDriver "Get All Cookies" and "Get Named Cookie" commands

https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/108

jgraham: Looks pretty like other testdriver APIs in that it's just calling a WebDriver endpoint.

Ms2ger: [WebDriver serialization issue](https://github.com/w3c/webdriver/issues/1562) is still open.

foolip: Is this something corner casey?

Ms2ger: It's non-ascii; there are probably tests that could use this that don't care about that.

foolip: What does WebDriver say now?

jgraham: Assumes all cookies can be represented as text in a JSON string.

Ms2ger: Seems like if this changes in WebDriver it's unlikely to break tests.

jgraham: I think it's probably fine to approve this without worrying about the encoding issue. If we end up with tests that depend on browser specific behaviour in the face of non-ascii cookies, it's a good reason to solve the underlying spec problem.

foolip: Approved with some comments about the WebDriver issue.
