## Agenda Items

### [RFC 75: async_promise_test](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/75)


- Daniel: Work has been moved to the backlog for now
- Philip: People have given up on this one probably. Asked for extra checks. Proposal: Just accept the risk and use it.
- JGraham: could grep for promise_setup
- Philip: I will reply. (Added [comment](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/75#issuecomment-1339616671))
- JGraham: In agreement with what I wrote in the past.
- Philip: Will approve. Should we merge it?
- Jgraham: Let's wait until January's meeting. If anything, review the implementation.
- Philip: Who should review the [implementation](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/27916)? 
- Philip: Will ask Panos.


### [RFC 121: Add testdriver.js support for Custom Handlers registration](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/121)

- Jgraham: we can close this one. This RFC is no longer required. Trying to see if there's a more general pattern we should be solving for. Should not hold this one up though. There is also a HTML PR with the changes. Need to check the state of that PR. It is waiting on approval from two vendors. If that HTML PR lands, the web platform PR can land. But first we need approval from WebKit or Gecko.

### [RFC 128: Consume User Activation](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/128)

- Jgraham: In nearly the same state as RFC 121. Has support from WebKit. There is a web driver PR for this.
- Philip: Does it need working group consensus?
- Jgraham: For adding a feature like this
- Sam: People outside the working group do not add features often.
- Jgraham: This could be put in HTML like the other one because it's interacting with an HTML feature. Would prefer that it is a PR into HTML.
- Sam: Is it worth writing down when we want them in web driver vs other
- Philip: Everything in webdriver now, a lot of it would be somewhere else.
- Jgraham: The web driver WG is focusing on BiDi. It's better to do that in HTML.
- Philip: Follow up action - Jgraham to add a comment

### Reviewing older infra issues
#### [sudo safaridriver --enable not working on macOS Catalina](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/21751)

- Sam: Should try to remove the workaround.
- Jscott: I will try this out.
