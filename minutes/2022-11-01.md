## Agenda Items

### Docker Hub credentials

```
Kyle: There's a wpt.fyi CI job to update the image on Docker Hub. Who has permission to that?
- Link to failing [worflow](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt.fyi/actions/workflows/docker-update.yml)
- Link to docker hub page: https://hub.docker.com/r/webplatformtests/wpt.fyi (webplatformtests is a user)

James: I do, but others should too.

Sam: I also did at some point, not sure if that's still the case.

James: I updated https://hub.docker.com/r/webplatformtests/wpt 3 months ago, so I must have had access then.

Sam: Looks like Robert Ma was the first person to push anything.

Philip: I've triggered a forgotten password email for the webplatformtests user.

James: Would it make more sense to use GitHub to store the docker images?
- [Github Container Registry](https://github.blog/2020-09-01-introducing-github-container-registry/)

Philip: Any risk for Taskcluster?

James: It's just URLs, but not completely certain.

Docs for this at https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry
```

Action items:
- Email Robert and Stephen regarding the docker hub account. @kyleju
- Need someone to experiment uploading an image to Container Registry
- Follow-up would be to do the same with the taskcluster images


### master to main branch rename

https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/80

```
Philip: Is this being worked on?

Sam: We get questions sometimes, so we should start trying to make some progress here

Philip: What's the risk and how can we figure it out?

Sam: The old document does that. I've moved it into the RFC.

James: Do we have a transitional period where we keep both branches updated? Starting with master mirroring to main and then reverse?

Philip: It seems risky to have a big flag day. The transitional thing seems more manageable.

Sam: At some point we have to delete the old branch and everything that wasn't updated will break.

Philip: We can stop updates before we actually delete the branch. We might notice things that don't update.

Sam: Does this work with GH's branch renaming for e.g. PRs.

Philip: No.

Panos: Will the slow rollout make bugs harder to spot. A missing branch might just cause an error message.

Sam: I think we'd find breakage pretty quickly.

Philip: Are you suggesting 1) we have a main branch we keep up to date with a CI job? 2) We use GH branch renaming to delete master and move to main?

Sam: The reality is that the things that might fall over are things that we're aware of e.g. sync. There are a small enough number of people involved that we could get rid of the transition period. There's not a huge number of systems. It depends how much work we want to put in to the case where there's something more than we're aware of.

James: We might discover there are more credentials we've lost...

Philip: https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/v19#pulls-update would allow renaming the PR branches with a script, but it wouldn't fix redirects.

Panos: Probably shouldn't do it this year. Maybe Q1 would be better.
```

### RFC 91: [testdriver] RemoteContext object

```
jgraham: Should return to draft or something; this still makes sense but no one is actively working on it.
```

### RFC 115: Add a new test method that returns AbortSignal 

https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/115

```
Philip: Can we just merge?

jgraham: Yes, can always back out if we made a mistake.

Philip: OK, merged.
```
